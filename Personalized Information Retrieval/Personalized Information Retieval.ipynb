As communicatedpreviously, we have disabled the ability to open entry and exit orderson these stocks when the market is closed. Please read below forfurther details:The ability to open market entry and exit orders is reserved for instruments which carry a certain minimum level of liquidity. We aretherefore not offering market orders outside of market hours for thesestocks.(..)Open CFD positions for these stocks will be made \\\"close only\\\" on Sunday January 31, 2021.\\\"Close only\\\" means that users cannot add morefunds to the existing CFD positions on these stocks. Please note thatusers can still adjust the Stop Loss and Take Profit on these CFDpositions.*some parts removed for brevityThe first point is a small inconvenience for me than a real issue since I mostly invest long term. However, it is not clear what are the consequences for the third point. I have only three positions affected by this (~ 10% total portfolio) and currently, the average P/L is about +10% for these affected positions.My understanding is that this was done as a protection for the hedge funds shorting many of these stocks,  by preventing aggressive sell and hold made by the retail investors.Anyway, for me, these investments were done long term and I cannot understand what is the effect of such a measure. Should I expect the price to drop (and sharply come back) for these? If I am \\\"long\\\" on these and they have good fundamentals and/or technical data, I expect the price to eventually grow, but I am also afraid of hitting the Stop Loss.Note: this is a very popular platform primarily targeted to beginners and I assume that this measure affects dozens of thousands of users.\",\n          \"What happened to most of Five Star Movement (M5S) deputies since the 2018 election? If I'm not mistaken, the Five Star Movement (M5S) won 227 seats in lower house in the 2018 election. But they only have 100 now. I see that 53 deputies split to De Maio's new party/group (Together for the Future, IpF) this year. But still that leaves 74 more of the original M5S deputies unaccounted for. So what happened to those since the 2018 election?\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"title\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 98,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Does being the player who kicked the ball, when the opponent scores an own goal, count as an assist?\",\n          \"What are the short term effects for a retail investor if the broker suddenly decided to allow close only for some positions?\",\n          \"What happened to most of Five Star Movement (M5S) deputies since the 2018 election?\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"timestamp\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"date\",\n        \"min\": \"2021-01-12 23:53:01\",\n        \"max\": \"2022-09-18 01:23:57\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 98,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"2021-11-20 22:45:56\",\n          \"2021-01-30 18:48:02\",\n          \"2022-08-20 20:10:02\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"score\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 5,\n        \"min\": -3,\n        \"max\": 32,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 23,\n        \"samples\": [\n          11,\n          5,\n          -2\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"views\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 1444,\n        \"min\": 18,\n        \"max\": 7567,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 93,\n        \"samples\": [\n          868,\n          79,\n          162\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"favorite\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.8548504142651103,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 3.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1.0,\n          2.0,\n          0.0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"user_id\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 2472378,\n        \"min\": 1325,\n        \"max\": 12194021,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 24,\n        \"samples\": [\n          923667,\n          1352706,\n          1532620\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"user_questions\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"user_answers\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"tags\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"rel_ids\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"rel_scores\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"rel_timestamps\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"best_answer\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 98,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"sports_26549\",\n          \"money_135667\",\n          \"politics_74939\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Talent doubles, also known as body doubles, are actors or models who stand in for the main actor in scenes where the actor's presence is not required, or to maintain continuity in a scene. This practice is common in various forms of media, including movies, television shows, and sometimes in live performances.\\n\\nChopstick usage, on the other hand, is a skill that involves using chopsticks to pick up food, which is a common utensil in many East Asian cultures. The portrayal of chopstick usage in American dramas would depend on the cultural setting of the story. If the drama is set in an East Asian context or aims to depict an authentic representation of that culture, then actors might be required to learn and perform chopstick usage. However, this would not involve the use of talent doubles.\\n\\nIn summary, talent doubles are used for reasons related to the actor's presence and continuity in a scene, while chopstick usage is a skill that actors might need to learn for authenticity in a culturally specific setting. The two concepts are unrelated in the context of American dramas.\"}]"
